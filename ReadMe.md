# Final Project: **SMS-ilate** 

## Summary
'SMS-ilate’ is a language learning sms platform which will translate a user’s message, in the language the user specifies, and message it back to them.

## Details 
Using the Google Translate API, the app will translate the contents of an sms into the language the user specifies. This is a one-step alternative to typing out your query, on google translate, in a browser. It avoids the added clutter of yet another app on your phone and still retain the history of your previous translations in your messages. It will have a backend database which will store all previous sentences searched, known words and the frequency of the words, for the various languages translated. 
<p><b>Secondary functions</b> could include a quizzing game based of the user’s database, a daily message with a new word and a revision list of sentences or words searched in each language. 
</p>

<p><b>Tertiary Function</b> could include a connection to a social API such as Facebook or Twitter. A user can share scores from the quiz or share progress in a language.

## Scenario
